# NFLBigDataBowl2022
Full code used in the 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl


How to reproduce the results:

Part 1: Training Data
1) Run BallLand_Full.ipynb - Finds x and y coordinates for the football at the frame where it lands.
2) Run FindBounceCatch.ipynb - Determine whether a particular punt is a bounce of is fielded/caught
3) Run FindSnap.ipynb - Finds which frame in the tracking data corresponds to the snap
4) Run PreSnap_Full.ipynb - Organizes all player positional data, football starting and landing coordinates, hang time, and bounce vs catch label for each punt.
5) Run ReturnLength.ipynb - Finds distance from punt landing x-coordinate to the x-coordinate of the ball at first contact.
6) Run BounceDirection.ipynb - Find the length of bounces and creates features for training MDN model.

Each of these notebooks will create a file: fb_land.csv, BounceCatch.csv, snapframe.csv, BC_AllPlayers.csv, FullTeamReturn.csv, BounceFeatures.csv.  The output of these notebooks has also been provided.  While the first 4 of these notebooks appear in the originally submitted file, the final 3 will produce the relevant training data for each of the models in question.


Part 2: Training Model
Run all four files (TwoOutcome, ThreeOutcomeModel, ReturnLength, MDN_Bivariate).  These notebooks will save the different models to make predictions on potential landing locations in the next section.  They also save the small arrays containing the mean and standard deviation for each of the training features so the new data can be quickly implemented.

The h5 files associated with the TensorFlow model save files used in contrusting the original plots have also been uploaded, as well as the normalization statistic files.
